## üßÆ **Mathematical Accuracy**

Since this is an educational library, mathematical accuracy is crucial:

- **Verify all formulas** against authoritative sources
- **Test numerical accuracy** with known test cases
- **Document mathematical assumptions** and limitations
- **Provide references** to mathematical sources
- **Explain the intuition** behind algorithms

## üéì **Educational Focus**

Remember that TensorCore is designed for learning:

- **Write clear, readable code** that students can understand
- **Explain the "why"** not just the "how"
- **Provide educational examples** and tutorials
- **Connect concepts** to real-world applications
- **Make complex ideas accessible** to beginners

## üöÄ **Feature Development Process**

### **Before Starting**
1. **Check existing issues** and discussions
2. **Propose your idea** in an issue or discussion
3. **Get feedback** from maintainers and community
4. **Plan your implementation** approach

### **During Development**
1. **Start with tests** (test-driven development)
2. **Implement incrementally** with frequent commits
3. **Document as you go** with clear comments
4. **Test thoroughly** at each step
5. **Get early feedback** from others

### **Before Submitting**
1. **Run all tests** and ensure they pass
2. **Check code style** and formatting
3. **Update documentation** as needed
4. **Write a clear description** of your changes
5. **Request review** from maintainers

## üêõ **Bug Reports**

When reporting bugs, please include:

- **Clear description** of the problem
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Expected behavior** vs actual behavior
- **Environment details** (OS, compiler, etc.)
- **Minimal code example** if possible

## üí° **Feature Requests**

When requesting features, please include:

- **Clear description** of the proposed feature
- **Educational value** and learning objectives
- **Use cases** and examples
- **Implementation approach** if you have ideas
- **References** to similar features in other libraries

## üìö **Educational Content Guidelines**

### **Tutorials**
- **Start with basics** and build up gradually
- **Use concrete examples** with real data
- **Explain the mathematics** behind concepts
- **Provide exercises** for hands-on learning
- **Connect to broader ML concepts**

### **Documentation**
- **Write for your target audience** (students learning ML)
- **Use clear, accessible language**
- **Include visualizations** where helpful
- **Provide code examples** for every concept
- **Link to additional resources**

## üîç **Code Review Process**

### **What We Look For**
- **Correctness**: Does the code work as intended?
- **Educational Value**: Does it help people learn?
- **Performance**: Is it efficient enough?
- **Documentation**: Is it well-documented?
