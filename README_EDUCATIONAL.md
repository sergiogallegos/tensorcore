# TensorCore: Understanding Machine Learning from the Ground Up

## üéì **Educational Philosophy**

TensorCore is not just another machine learning library‚Äîit's a **learning platform** designed to demystify the complex world of modern ML frameworks. By implementing core concepts from scratch, we can understand not just *what* these libraries do, but *how* and *why* they work.

## üß† **Why Understanding the Fundamentals Matters**

### **The Black Box Problem**
Modern ML frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow are incredibly powerful, but they often feel like "black boxes." You call a function, get a result, but you don't understand what's happening inside. This creates several problems:

1. **Debugging Difficulties**: When something goes wrong, you don't know where to look
2. **Limited Innovation**: You can only use what's already implemented
3. **Poor Intuition**: You can't predict how changes will affect your model
4. **Research Barriers**: You can't implement new ideas or algorithms

### **The Learning Advantage**
By building ML concepts from scratch, you gain:

- **Deep Understanding**: You know exactly how each operation works
- **Mathematical Intuition**: You understand the underlying mathematics
- **Implementation Skills**: You can build new features and algorithms
- **Debugging Mastery**: You can trace through any computation
- **Research Capability**: You can implement cutting-edge research

## üî¨ **Core Concepts Explained**

### **1. Tensors: The Foundation of Everything**

#### **What is a Tensor?**
A tensor is a generalization of scalars, vectors, and matrices to higher dimensions:

- **Scalar (0D)**: A single number (e.g., `3.14`)
- **Vector (1D)**: An array of numbers (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4]`)
- **Matrix (2D)**: A 2D array (e.g., `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`)
- **Tensor (3D+)**: Higher-dimensional arrays (e.g., `[[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]]`)

#### **Why Tensors Matter in ML**
- **Data Representation**: Images, text, audio‚Äîall become tensors
- **Model Parameters**: Neural network weights are tensors
- **Computations**: All ML operations work on tensors
- **Memory Efficiency**: Tensors enable efficient batch processing

#### **Tensor Operations: The Building Blocks**
```cpp
// Element-wise operations (broadcasting)
Tensor a = {1, 2, 3, 4};
Tensor b = {5, 6, 7, 8};
Tensor c = a + b;  // [6, 8, 10, 12]

// Matrix multiplication (linear transformations)
Tensor weights = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};
Tensor input = {5, 6};
Tensor output = weights.matmul(input);  // Linear layer computation
```

### **2. Automatic Differentiation: The Magic Behind Deep Learning**

#### **The Problem**
Neural networks have millions of parameters. How do we know how to adjust each parameter to improve performance?

#### **The Solution: Backpropagation**
Automatic differentiation computes gradients automatically:

1. **Forward Pass**: Compute the output given inputs
2. **Loss Calculation**: Measure how wrong the prediction is
3. **Backward Pass**: Compute gradients using the chain rule
4. **Parameter Update**: Adjust parameters in the direction that reduces loss

#### **Why This Matters**
- **Efficiency**: No need to derive gradients manually
- **Accuracy**: Numerical precision in gradient computation
- **Flexibility**: Works with any differentiable function
- **Scalability**: Handles complex, deep networks

#### **The Chain Rule in Action**
```cpp
// Forward pass
Tensor x = {2.0};
Tensor y = x * x;        // y = x¬≤
Tensor z = y + 1;        // z = x¬≤ + 1
Tensor loss = z * z;     // loss = (x¬≤ + 1)¬≤

// Backward pass (automatic)
// dloss/dx = 2(x¬≤ + 1) * 2x = 4x(x¬≤ + 1)
// At x = 2: dloss/dx = 4 * 2 * (4 + 1) = 40
```

### **3. Neural Networks: Learning from Data**

#### **The Universal Approximation Theorem**
Neural networks can approximate any continuous function given enough neurons. This is why they're so powerful!

#### **How Neural Networks Learn**
1. **Forward Propagation**: Data flows through the network
2. **Loss Computation**: Compare prediction with true value
3. **Backpropagation**: Compute gradients for each parameter
4. **Gradient Descent**: Update parameters to reduce loss
5. **Repeat**: Continue until convergence

#### **Key Components**
- **Layers**: Linear transformations + activation functions
- **Activation Functions**: Introduce non-linearity
- **Loss Functions**: Measure prediction quality
- **Optimizers**: Update parameters efficiently

### **4. Activation Functions: Adding Non-Linearity**

#### **Why We Need Activation Functions**
Without activation functions, neural networks would just be linear transformations, no matter how many layers you add:

```cpp
// Without activation: y = W‚ÇÉ(W‚ÇÇ(W‚ÇÅx + b‚ÇÅ) + b‚ÇÇ) + b‚ÇÉ
// This is equivalent to: y = W‚ÇÉW‚ÇÇW‚ÇÅx + (W‚ÇÉW‚ÇÇb‚ÇÅ + W‚ÇÉb‚ÇÇ + b‚ÇÉ)
// Still just a linear function!

// With activation: y = œÉ(W‚ÇÉ(œÉ(W‚ÇÇ(œÉ(W‚ÇÅx + b‚ÇÅ) + b‚ÇÇ)) + b‚ÇÉ)
// Now we have non-linearity and can learn complex patterns!
```

#### **Common Activation Functions**
- **ReLU**: `f(x) = max(0, x)` - Simple, efficient, avoids vanishing gradients
- **Sigmoid**: `f(x) = 1/(1 + e^(-x))` - Smooth, bounded, good for probabilities
- **Tanh**: `f(x) = (e^x - e^(-x))/(e^x + e^(-x))` - Centered, bounded
- **Softmax**: `f(x_i) = e^(x_i) / Œ£e^(x_j)` - Converts to probabilities

### **5. Loss Functions: Measuring Performance**

#### **The Goal**
We need a way to measure how "wrong" our predictions are so we can improve them.

#### **Common Loss Functions**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: `L = (1/n)Œ£(y_pred - y_true)¬≤`
  - Good for regression problems
  - Penalizes large errors more heavily
  
- **Cross-Entropy Loss**: `L = -Œ£y_true * log(y_pred)`
  - Good for classification problems
  - Measures probability distribution differences

- **Huber Loss**: Combines MSE and MAE
  - Robust to outliers
  - Smooth gradient near zero

### **6. Optimization: Finding the Best Parameters**

#### **Gradient Descent**
The most fundamental optimization algorithm:

1. Compute gradient: `‚àáL = ‚àÇL/‚àÇŒ∏`
2. Update parameters: `Œ∏ = Œ∏ - Œ±‚àáL`
3. Repeat until convergence

Where `Œ±` (alpha) is the learning rate.

#### **Advanced Optimizers**
- **Adam**: Adaptive learning rates for each parameter
- **RMSprop**: Adapts learning rate based on recent gradients
- **Momentum**: Accelerates convergence in consistent directions

### **7. Convolutional Neural Networks: Learning from Images**

#### **The Problem with Fully Connected Networks**
For images, fully connected networks have too many parameters and don't respect spatial structure.

#### **The Solution: Convolutions**
Convolutions apply the same filter across the entire image, respecting spatial structure:

```cpp
// Convolution operation
Tensor image = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};  // 3x3 image
Tensor filter = {{1, 0}, {0, 1}};                   // 2x2 filter
Tensor result = conv2d(image, filter);              // Apply filter
```

#### **Why Convolutions Work**
- **Parameter Sharing**: Same filter used everywhere
- **Translation Invariance**: Recognizes patterns regardless of location
- **Hierarchical Features**: Early layers detect edges, later layers detect objects

### **8. Recurrent Neural Networks: Learning from Sequences**

#### **The Problem**
Standard neural networks can't handle sequences because they don't have memory.

#### **The Solution: Recurrent Connections**
RNNs maintain hidden state that carries information from previous time steps:

```cpp
// RNN computation
Tensor h_t = tanh(W_hh * h_{t-1} + W_xh * x_t + b);
Tensor y_t = W_hy * h_t + b_y;
```

#### **Applications**
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understanding text
- **Time Series**: Predicting future values
- **Speech Recognition**: Processing audio sequences

    // Forward pass
    Tensor y_pred = w * X + b;
    
    // Compute loss
    Tensor loss = mse_loss(y_pred, y);
    
    // Backward pass (compute gradients)
    Tensor dw = 2 * (y_pred - y) * X;
    Tensor db = 2 * (y_pred - y);
    
    // Update parameters
    w = w - 0.01 * dw.mean();

}

        Tensor h2 = sigmoid(W2.matmul(h1) + b2);  // Output layer
        return h2;
    }
    
    Tensor backward(Tensor x, Tensor y_true) {
        // Forward pass
        Tensor h1 = relu(W1.matmul(x) + b1);
        Tensor y_pred = sigmoid(W2.matmul(h1) + b2);
        
        // Compute loss
        Tensor loss = binary_cross_entropy_loss(y_pred, y_true);
        
        // Backward pass (simplified)
        // ... gradient computation ...
        
        return loss;
    }
};
```
